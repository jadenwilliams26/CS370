# CS370 <br />
Within project two we were given nearly all of the code for the agent to work. I wrote the code within the main loop that allowed for the Pirate to make a decision between exploration, or exploitation. Exploration would allow for the agent to learn and develop its knowledge base, which is great early on. Exploitation allows for the agent to use its knowledge to make the best decision. This project was incrdibly fun, and it showed me how I learn as a computer scientist. I start by formulating a plan, how I want it to be executed, then I begin my execution as methodically as possible. Once I am into my execution phase, I tend to realize the scale of the problem, whether it be larger or smaller than I realized, and I reasses my plan to fit the actual size of the problem. <br /> <br />
As a computer scientist, I am here to take in the clients needs and produce a product that suits their needs and exceeds their expectations. I have an ethical responsibility to remain transparent at all times, especially when working with Machine Learning. I am responsible for how any ML model is trained that is under my supervision, therefore I must ensure it is being trained with as little bias as humanly possible and I will always publish the data that the model uses for its training.
